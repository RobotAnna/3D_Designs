### Print
To print these plates, ensure that the final height is less than 1mm. Use the following slicer settings:
* Layer height = 0.2mm
* 2 walls
* Add a pause or color change after the 2nd layer.

It should print 2x layers in the base color, and 2x layers in the top color. Four layers in total.

### Magnets
I'd suggest to add holes into the base to embed magnets. It's a bit of extra work now, but it means if the sign breaks in the future, you can still rescue the magnets for a different project. My magnets were 12mm diameter, 2mm thickness.
