Blank panels for eurorack modular synth, based on intellijel specifications. Modular design: export custom sized panels.

My boyfriend spends a lot of his hard-earned cash on modular synth accessories; I made him some blank panels in matt black PLA+, so he didn't have to purchase them. After receiving the first panel he asked for a different size, and then one moreâ€¦ so I made a parametric design, to generate every possible size.

Feel free to use &/or modify this design for your own needs.

Recommendations:
Let the print cool on the plate, to avoid warping.
Tested on Prusa MK4S with 0.4mm and 0.6mm nozzle, in PLA
Use 6mm m3 screws, when the board is printed 2mm thick.

### Print
I used the following settings in PrusaSlicer

* Print settings: 0.20mm STRUCTURAL
* Nozzle: HF0.4 nozzle
* Infill: 100%

Layers and perimeters:
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* First layer: 0.2mm
* Solid layers: 3 top and bottom
* Minimum shell thickness: 0.6mm top and bottom

Infill:
* Fill density: 100%
* Fill pattern: Rectilinear
* Top fill pattern: Monotonic lines

Add a color change after 3 layers. It should print 3x layers in the base color, and 5x layers in the top color. Eight layers in total.
