Make a replacement handle for your venetian blinds with a wooden rod and printed hook and end cap.

A friend's venetian blind was broken: no more handle. I made a new handle by printing a hook and end cap for an 8mm wooden dowel. Feel free to use this printfile, or alter the dimensions in OpenSCAD and export your own STL for any width rod.
